    id: 'what-is-fantasy-football',
    question: 'What is fantasy football and how does it work?',
    answer: `Fantasy football is a game where you create a virtual team by drafting real NFL players. Your team earns points based on how those players perform in actual NFL games. 

Here's how it works:
‚Ä¢ **Draft**: You and your league mates take turns selecting players
‚Ä¢ **Set Lineups**: Each week, choose which players to start
‚Ä¢ **Scoring**: Your players earn points for touchdowns, yards, etc.
‚Ä¢ **Win/Lose**: The team with more points wins that week's matchup
‚Ä¢ **Season**: Play through the NFL season, including playoffs

The goal is to have the best-performing team and win your league championship!`,

  {
    id: 'draft-order',
    question: 'How is draft order determined?',
    answer: `Draft order can be set several ways:

**Random (Recommended)**
‚Ä¢ Computer generates random order
‚Ä¢ Most fair and unbiased method
‚Ä¢ Can be done live or preset

**Commissioner Choice**
‚Ä¢ League commissioner manually sets order
‚Ä¢ Allows for strategic placement
‚Ä¢ Should be agreed upon by all members

**Previous Season Results**
‚Ä¢ Worst team picks first (consolation)
‚Ä¢ Best team picks last
‚Ä¢ Encourages competitive balance

**Fun Methods**
‚Ä¢ Draft lottery with ping pong balls
‚Ä¢ Physical competition (mini-golf, trivia)
‚Ä¢ Random events (dice roll, card draw)

Most leagues use random order to ensure fairness.`,

  {
    id: 'ppr-scoring',
    question: 'What is PPR scoring?',
    answer: `PPR stands for "Points Per Reception." It's a scoring system that awards points for each catch a player makes.

**Standard PPR**: 1 point per reception
**Half PPR**: 0.5 points per reception
**Non-PPR**: 0 points per reception

**Why use PPR?**
‚Ä¢ Makes wide receivers and pass-catching RBs more valuable
‚Ä¢ Rewards consistent players who get targets
‚Ä¢ Adds more strategy to player evaluation
‚Ä¢ Generally creates higher scoring games

**Impact on Strategy:**
‚Ä¢ Slot receivers become more valuable
‚Ä¢ Pass-catching RBs like Christian McCaffrey get a boost
‚Ä¢ Volume receivers preferred over big-play specialists
‚Ä¢ Changes draft rankings significantly

Most modern leagues use some form of PPR scoring.`,

  {
    id: 'waiver-order',
    question: 'How does waiver order work?',
    answer: `Waiver order determines who gets first priority when claiming free agents.

**Common Systems:**

**1. Rolling Waivers (Most Popular)**
‚Ä¢ After you claim a player, you move to the back of the line
‚Ä¢ Encourages strategic timing of claims
‚Ä¢ Most fair over the season

**2. Reverse Standings**
‚Ä¢ Worst team gets first priority each week
‚Ä¢ Helps maintain competitive balance
‚Ä¢ Based on current win-loss record

**3. FAAB (Free Agent Acquisition Budget)**
‚Ä¢ Each team gets a budget (usually $100)
‚Ä¢ Bid on players with your remaining budget
‚Ä¢ Highest bid wins the player
‚Ä¢ Most strategic but more complex

**Waiver Processing:**
‚Ä¢ Claims typically process Tuesday/Wednesday
‚Ä¢ Multiple claims processed in priority order
‚Ä¢ Failed claims don't affect your waiver position (in rolling)

Plan your waiver claims carefully - timing matters!`,

    id: 'oracle-accuracy',
    question: 'How accurate is Oracle AI?',
    answer: `Oracle AI is our advanced machine learning system with impressive accuracy rates:

**Overall Accuracy:**
‚Ä¢ Player performance predictions: ~73% accuracy
‚Ä¢ Trade recommendations: ~79% success rate
‚Ä¢ Lineup optimization: ~82% optimal choices
‚Ä¢ Injury impact assessment: ~87% accuracy

**What Oracle Analyzes:**
‚Ä¢ Historical player performance (5+ years)
‚Ä¢ Weather conditions and venue effects
‚Ä¢ Injury reports and recovery timelines
‚Ä¢ Team offensive schemes and game scripts
‚Ä¢ Vegas betting lines and public sentiment
‚Ä¢ Real-time news and social media sentiment

**Confidence Levels:**
‚Ä¢ **High (90%+)**: Very reliable predictions
‚Ä¢ **Medium (70-89%)**: Good predictions with some uncertainty
‚Ä¢ **Low (<70%)**: High variance situations

**Important Notes:**
‚Ä¢ Football has inherent randomness - no prediction is 100%
‚Ä¢ Use Oracle as one tool among many
‚Ä¢ Higher confidence predictions are more reliable
‚Ä¢ System improves as it learns from your league

Oracle is most accurate for established players in standard game scripts.`,

  {
    id: 'trade-vetoes',
    question: 'When should trades be vetoed?',
    answer: `Trade vetoes should be rare and only used in extreme circumstances:

**Valid Reasons to Veto:**
‚Ä¢ **Obvious Collusion**: Teams working together unfairly
‚Ä¢ **Roster Dumping**: Team giving up and trading away good players
‚Ä¢ **Taking Advantage**: Experienced player exploiting newcomer
‚Ä¢ **Impossible to Justify**: No reasonable person would make the trade

**Invalid Reasons:**
‚Ä¢ You don't like the trade
‚Ä¢ It makes another team too good
‚Ä¢ You wanted to trade for those players
‚Ä¢ The trade seems "unfair" but both sides have reasons

**Best Practices:**
‚Ä¢ Require clear evidence of collusion
‚Ä¢ Use league vote (majority needed)
‚Ä¢ Commissioner should explain veto reasons
‚Ä¢ Set veto policies before the season
‚Ä¢ Consider 24-48 hour review periods

**Alternatives to Vetoing:**
‚Ä¢ Talk to both teams about their reasoning
‚Ä¢ Set up trade review committee
‚Ä¢ Use commissioner approval instead of league votes
‚Ä¢ Education for newer players

Remember: Bad trades aren't necessarily vetoable trades. Let teams manage themselves unless there's clear misconduct.`,

    id: 'scoring-delays',
    question: 'Why are scores delayed or incorrect?',
    answer: `Scoring delays can happen for several reasons:

**Common Causes:**
‚Ä¢ **NFL Stat Corrections**: Official stats sometimes change post-game
‚Ä¢ **Data Provider Delays**: Our sources may have temporary delays
‚Ä¢ **Complex Plays**: Unusual plays require manual review
‚Ä¢ **Technical Issues**: Server or connection problems

**Typical Timeline:**
‚Ä¢ **Live Scoring**: Updates every 30-60 seconds during games
‚Ä¢ **Final Scores**: Usually correct within 30 minutes of game end
‚Ä¢ **Stat Corrections**: Can happen up to 48 hours later
‚Ä¢ **Playoff Implications**: May take longer during crucial games

**What We Do:**
‚Ä¢ Monitor multiple official sources
‚Ä¢ Cross-reference NFL.com and ESPN data
‚Ä¢ Automatic error detection and correction
‚Ä¢ Manual review for disputed plays
‚Ä¢ Push notifications for major corrections

**If You Notice Issues:**
‚Ä¢ Check if it's an official NFL stat correction
‚Ä¢ Compare with multiple sources (NFL.com, ESPN)
‚Ä¢ Report persistent discrepancies to support
‚Ä¢ Remember that official stats are final

**Pro Tip**: Most "incorrect" scores are actually stat corrections from the NFL. Always verify with official sources before reporting issues.`,

    id: 'draft-autopick',
    question: 'What happens if I miss my draft pick?',

**Autopick System:**
‚Ä¢ Automatically selects best available player
‚Ä¢ Uses your pre-draft rankings if set
‚Ä¢ Follows position needs and ADP
‚Ä¢ Prioritizes starters over bench depth

**Setting Up Autopick:**
‚Ä¢ **Pre-Draft Rankings**: Rank players before draft
‚Ä¢ **Position Priorities**: Set preferred draft strategy
‚Ä¢ **Avoid Lists**: Mark players you don't want
‚Ä¢ **Backup Queue**: Queue picks in advance

**During the Draft:**
‚Ä¢ **Timer Warning**: Get alerts at 30 and 10 seconds
‚Ä¢ **Mobile Notifications**: Push alerts to your phone
‚Ä¢ **Pick Trading**: Can trade picks even if you miss
‚Ä¢ **Late Arrivals**: Join mid-draft and autopick catches up

**Best Practices:**
‚Ä¢ Arrive 15 minutes early
‚Ä¢ Set pre-rankings as backup
‚Ä¢ Have stable internet connection
‚Ä¢ Use mobile app as backup
‚Ä¢ Communicate with commissioner if issues arise

**Recovery Strategies:**
‚Ä¢ Review autopicked team immediately
‚Ä¢ Identify obvious needs or mistakes
‚Ä¢ Use waiver wire to address gaps
‚Ä¢ Make trades after draft to improve roster

The autopick system is smart, but preparation is still key!`,
