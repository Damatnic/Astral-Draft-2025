## Deployment Process

### Automated Deployment Pipeline

#### 1. Trigger Deployment

**For Staging:**
```bash
# Push to develop branch
git push origin develop
```

**For Production:**
```bash
# Create and push tag
git tag -a v4.1.0 -m "Release v4.1.0"
git push origin v4.1.0
```

#### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Execution

The deployment follows this automated sequence:

1. **Pre-deployment Validation**
   - Run critical test suites
   - Verify environment health
   - Check deployment prerequisites

2. **Build and Push**
   - Build optimized Docker image
   - Push to container registry
   - Sign container image with cosign

3. **Database Migration** (if required)
   - Backup current database
   - Run migration scripts
   - Verify migration success

4. **Blue-Green Deployment**
   - Deploy to inactive slot (blue/green)
   - Run health checks on new deployment
   - Run smoke tests
   - Switch traffic to new deployment
   - Monitor for 5 minutes
   - Clean up old deployment

5. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Run comprehensive health checks
   - Verify critical user journeys
   - Check monitoring metrics
   - Send deployment notifications

### Manual Deployment (Emergency)

For emergency deployments outside normal process:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd v4/

# Set environment variables
export ENVIRONMENT=production
export IMAGE_TAG=v4.1.0-hotfix
export ROLLBACK_REASON="emergency-deployment"

# Execute deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh \
  --environment production \
  --image v4.1.0-hotfix \
  --strategy blue-green \
  --force

# Verify deployment
./scripts/health-check.sh \
  --environment production \
  --check-type full \
  https://astraldraft.com

   - Core application functionality
   - API endpoint validation
   - Database read/write operations

3. **Performance Verification**
   - Response time within SLA (< 2 seconds)
   - Resource utilization normal
   - No memory leaks detected
   - Database query performance acceptable

### Manual Verification Checklist

- Throughput (requests/second)
- Active user sessions

#### Infrastructure Metrics
- CPU utilization (target: < 70%)
- Memory usage (target: < 80%)
- Disk space (target: < 80%)
- Network I/O

#### Database Metrics

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

The system automatically initiates rollback if:
- Health checks fail after deployment
- Error rate exceeds 5% for 5 minutes
- Response time exceeds 10 seconds
- Critical security alerts triggered

### Manual Rollback

#### Quick Rollback (Previous Version)
```bash
./scripts/rollback.sh \
  --environment production \
  --reason "deployment-issue" \
  --force
```

#### Rollback to Specific Version
```bash
./scripts/rollback.sh \
  --environment production \
  --version v4.0.5 \
  --reason "critical-bug-fix" \
  --type application
```

#### Full Rollback (Application + Database)
```bash
./scripts/rollback.sh \
  --environment production \
  --version v4.0.5 \
  --type full \
  --reason "data-corruption"
```

### Rollback Verification

After rollback:
1. Verify application is running previous version
2. Run comprehensive health checks
3. Verify critical user journeys
4. Monitor error rates and performance
5. Communicate rollback completion
