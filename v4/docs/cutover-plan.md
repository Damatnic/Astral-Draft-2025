# Astral Draft V4 Cutover Plan

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the complete migration strategy from Astral Draft v3 to v4, ensuring zero data loss and minimal downtime during the transition.

## Timeline
- **T-14 days**: Begin pre-cutover preparations
- **T-7 days**: Data migration dry run
- **T-3 days**: Final testing and validation
- **T-0**: Production cutover
- **T+7 days**: Post-cutover monitoring

## Phase 1: Pre-Cutover (T-14 to T-3)

### Data Migration Preparation
- [ ] Complete database schema mapping v3 → v4
- [ ] Validate data transformation scripts
- [ ] Run migration on staging environment
- [ ] Performance test with production data volume
- [ ] Create rollback procedures

### Feature Validation
- [ ] Complete feature parity checklist
- [ ] User acceptance testing (UAT)
- [ ] Load testing with expected traffic
- [ ] Mobile app compatibility verification
- [ ] Third-party integration testing

### Communication Plan
- [ ] Notify users 7 days before cutover
- [ ] Prepare maintenance page
- [ ] Update status page
- [ ] Brief support team
- [ ] Create FAQ documentation

## Phase 2: Cutover Day (T-0)

### Hour -2: Final Preparations
```bash
# 1. Enable maintenance mode on v3
./scripts/maintenance-mode.sh enable

# 2. Create final backup
./scripts/backup-production.sh

# 3. Stop write operations
./scripts/readonly-mode.sh enable
```

### Hour 0: Data Migration
```bash
# 1. Export v3 data
pg_dump astral_v3 > backup_final.sql

# 2. Transform data for v4
python scripts/transform-data.py backup_final.sql

# 3. Import to v4 database
psql astral_v4 < transformed_data.sql

# 4. Verify data integrity
./scripts/verify-migration.sh
```

### Hour +1: Service Cutover
```bash
# 1. Update DNS records
./scripts/update-dns.sh v4

# 2. Enable v4 services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# 3. Run health checks
./scripts/health-check.sh --comprehensive

# 4. Smoke test critical paths
./scripts/smoke-test.sh
```

### Hour +2: Validation
- [ ] Verify user authentication
- [ ] Test league operations
- [ ] Confirm draft functionality
- [ ] Validate payment processing
- [ ] Check Oracle AI predictions
- [ ] Monitor error rates

## Phase 3: Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
- Response time > 3 seconds p95
- Database connection failures
- Payment processing failures

### Manual Rollback Process
```bash
# 1. Switch DNS back to v3
./scripts/update-dns.sh v3

# 2. Restore v3 database state
./scripts/restore-backup.sh latest

# 3. Disable v4 services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# 4. Re-enable v3 services
./scripts/start-v3.sh

# 5. Verify v3 functionality
./scripts/health-check.sh --v3
```

## Phase 4: Post-Cutover (T+1 to T+7)

### Monitoring Checklist
- [ ] Performance metrics (hourly)
- [ ] Error rates (continuous)
- [ ] User feedback analysis
- [ ] Database performance
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] Mobile app reviews

### Success Criteria
- ✅ 99.9% uptime maintained
- ✅ < 2s average page load time
- ✅ < 1% error rate
- ✅ All critical features operational
- ✅ Positive user feedback (> 80%)

## Data Migration Details

### User Data
```sql
-- Map v3 users to v4 schema
INSERT INTO v4.users (id, email, username, created_at)
SELECT user_id, email, username, created_date
FROM v3.users;
```

### League Data
```sql
-- Migrate leagues with new structure
INSERT INTO v4.leagues (id, name, commissioner_id, settings)
SELECT 
  league_id,
  league_name,
  commissioner_user_id,
  jsonb_build_object(
    'scoring', scoring_settings,
    'roster', roster_settings
  )
FROM v3.leagues;
```

### Transaction History
- Preserve all historical transactions
- Map to new transaction types
- Maintain audit trail

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Payment Processing**
   - Mitigation: Dual-run payments for 24 hours
   - Rollback: Immediate switch to v3 processor

2. **Real-time Draft**
   - Mitigation: No active drafts during cutover
   - Rollback: Restore draft state from backup

3. **User Sessions**
   - Mitigation: Force re-authentication
   - Rollback: Clear all sessions

### Contingency Plans
- **Partial Failure**: Run v3 and v4 in parallel
- **Data Corruption**: Restore from hourly backups
- **Performance Issues**: Scale infrastructure immediately
