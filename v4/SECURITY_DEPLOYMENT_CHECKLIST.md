  ```javascript
  // This should be detected and blocked
  POST /api/search { query: "'; DROP TABLE users; --" }
  ```

- [ ] **Rate Limit Test**
  ```bash
  # This should trigger rate limiting
  for i in {1..20}; do curl https://your-app.com/api/auth/login; done
  ```

- [ ] **CSRF Protection Test**
  ```javascript
  // This should fail without proper CSRF token
  POST /api/settings (without CSRF token)
